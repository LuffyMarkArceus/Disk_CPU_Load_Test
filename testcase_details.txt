						Test Scenario: SSH Connectivity Test

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	
	This test scenario focuses on verifying the SSH connectivity to a remote server using both password and key-based authentication methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup:

	Prepare a remote server with SSH enabled and accessible.

	Obtain the following information:
	
	Hostname or IP address of the remote server
	
	SSH port number
	
	Username for authentication
	
	Password for password-based authentication
	
	Path to a valid private key file for key-based authentication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools Used:

	Python with the paramiko library for SSH connectivity testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test Steps:

	Initialize the SSH client.
	
	Configure the SSH client to use the system host keys and auto-add policy.
	
	Attempt to establish an SSH connection with password-based authentication:
		a. Provide the hostname, port, username, and password to the SSH client.
		b. Verify if the SSH connection is established successfully.
		c. Close the SSH connection.
	
	Attempt to establish an SSH connection with key-based authentication:
		a. Load the private key from the specified file path.
		b. Provide the hostname, port, username, and private key to the SSH client.
		c. Verify if the SSH connection is established successfully.
		d. Close the SSH connection.
	
	Return a pass/fail status based on the success or failure of the SSH connectivity tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pass/Fail Criteria:

	Pass: 
		Both the password-based and key-based SSH connections are established successfully.

	Fail: Any of the following conditions occur:
		Authentication fails (incorrect username, password, or private key).
		SSH connection cannot be established.
		An error occurs during the SSH connectivity test.
